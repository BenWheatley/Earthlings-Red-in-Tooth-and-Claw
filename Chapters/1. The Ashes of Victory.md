## Chapter I – The Ashes of Victory

London, September 28th, 1899.

Two years had passed since the Martians died.

Yet London still breathed, smoke pouring forth from chimneys, factories and trains. Beneath the rebuilt facades and polished memorials, the city’s heart beat to a strange, uneasy rhythm. The air smelled faintly of iron and disinfectant, of scorched stone and restless ambition. On the Thames, the sunset caught the twisted ribs of a fallen tripod, its shadow stretching across the water like the skeleton of a heathen god, now a memorial to those who had died in the failed invasion.

Though the people themselves no longer spoke of it as “the invasion”; instead, they called it “the visitation”, as though divine purpose might soften the memory of near-annihilation. But the ground remembered. Some nights, when the fog rolled low and the lamps burned orange, the cobbles seemed to hum with the ghosts of heat-rays and dying men.

Dr. Elizabeth Choudhary stepped down from the train at Paddington Station, her gloved hand tightening on the handle of a weathered medical case. The crowd parted awkwardly around her, an Indian woman in an English sari, marked by an Imperial Priority ticket. She felt their alienating gazes as unpleasantly as the cold British rain. Her journey from Calcutta had been long, but the true distance was not geography, but one of culture: although the Empire had made the world smaller, it had never erased those differences.

Sir Arthur Pembroke awaited her on the platform, as precise as the ticking of a chronometer. His uniform had been tailored down to a civilian cut, the medals tucked discreetly away, but he carried the posture of a man who had stood against the impossible and survived. He removed his hat in greeting.

“Dr. Choudhary, I presume. Welcome to London, what remains of it.”

“Thank you, Sir Arthur,” she replied, her English crisp but musical. “I see the Martians were thorough.”

A faint smile touched his lips, then vanished. “Thorough, yes. Though fortunately also as foolish and mortal as any man.”

Around them, the station pulsed with tension. Empire soldiers in khaki and blue patrolled between porters and foreign delegates. French engineers in stained coats argued beside Russian physicists and German mathematicians; American journalists darted about with notebooks, some offering a small fortune for a single tripod limb; a group of Japanese officials observed everything in silence. Newspaper stands silently cried from every corner:

```
   MARTIAN CULTS RAIDED IN BIRMINGHAM!
   NEW HEAT-RAY TEST ENDS IN DISASTER!
   ROYAL ASTRONOMERS REPORT STRANGE LIGHTS ON MARS!
```

In one direction she saw group of beggars clustered beneath a statue of Lady Britannia, a slowly-greening copper plaque at its base proclaiming “England Triumphant!”; in another direction, she saw an urchin selling fragments of what was supposedly Martian metal, promising luck against “the next lot”.

Sir Arthur offered his arm. “If you will, Doctor. The carriage is waiting.”

They walked through a city patched together by grief and ingenuity. New ministries had risen beside the ruins of old cathedrals; of these, they were headed to the Imperial Martian Research Institute: a looming wonder of the Industrial Age, a tower half glass, half steel, echoing the now-lost Crystal Palace and the still-standing Eiffel Tower. Between the buildings lay dozens of fenced yards filled with Martian wreckage: the curve of a heat-ray emitter, the blackened shell of a fighting-machine’s leg, and strange, half-living metal that still resisted the touch of tools.

“All this,” said Sir Arthur, “we study in hopes of understanding our would-be destroyers.”

“Understanding,” Elizabeth demurred, “I think not, from the reports.”

As she spoke, loud hiss drew their eyes — engineers were testing one of the recovered heat-rays. The target, a rubble pile of which there were still all too many, glowed orange for a brief instant, the outer surface exploding from the stress, but the generator powering it gave out almost immediately and the effect ceased as rapidly as it had started. The crowd gasped, one man crossed himself, two women fainted. Elizabeth noticed all that along with the frustration on the technicians’ faces as their equipment failed them.

“Two years,” said Sir Arthur, “and we still cannot make their machines obey.”

“You can barely make them speak,” she replied, “but I am not surprised. It is trivial to calculate the energy needed to get from Mars to Earth as fast as they did, and there is simply no chemical reaction that can deliver that much. Their science is… not of our kind.”

“True. Some call it witchcraft; others, divine punishment. The truth is even less comforting.”

“Less, Sir Arthur?”

“I understand that in your homeland, many worship other gods? Krishna and so forth?”

“That is correct, Sir Arthur.” She felt it best to let the man speak rather than to reveal any specifics. On the journey there had been all together too many conversations with those that assumed all Indians must be Hindu, and many more who assumed they must all be Muslim. Some would try to convert her, while others thought themselves clever for knowing the basics of her faith… though often even that was some exciting Romance they had read and mistaken for truth. In both cases, she found it served her best to play whichever role was expected of her, dropping the act as soon as such people turned aside.

“Until the invasion, this Kingdom was unified in its belief in one singular God, all good, all knowing, and all powerful. The invasion causes a crisis of faith in many, asking how such a being could permit so much death, how so many innocents could die.”

She didn't let herself smile, the horrors Sir Arthur spoke of were very real, but Elizabeth was pleased that Sir Arthur was neither of the men she feared he might be. Here the role she could play was “Doctor”, a hard-won title in this age, and her favourite.

“So,” she ventured, “visitors from the Heavens make people lose faith in the Heaven they'd been promised?”

Sir Arthur nodded solemnly. “I feel like an Athenian forced to face the fact that nobody ever found Athena when they climbed to the top of Mount Olympus.”

Doctor Choudhary nodded silently. She had heard a handful of tales about the Greeks, but knew that she knew little of them and cared less for mythology. Perhaps this metaphor was like suggesting no sage had ever found Shiva waiting in the snow of the peaks of Kailash, perhaps not, but now was not the time to ask.

They carriage went through an archway and came to a halt in an enclosed inner courtyard. Sir Arthur, gentleman that he was, helped Doctor Choudhary disembark; behind them the driver saw to the horses.

The corridors within the Institute proper echoed with the hum of experiment and whispered rivalry. British scientists eyed Elizabeth with polite suspicion; a few nodded curtly, others turned away. Same as it ever was, even in her university days

They paused before a display case: fragments of Martian alloy, curved in a mesmerising spiral, the space within genuinely defying geometry: a cast iron shaft had been added by the curator, appearing bent and broken as it crossed the lines of the spiral in the same manner as a straw in water, except this was apparently no mere illusion, but somehow a fundamental part of the space the structure occupied. Elizabeth stared uneasily at it.

“We’ve lost three men cataloguing that specimen. The Director calls it a ‘non-Euclidean artifact.’ I call it a warning.”

“A warning of what?” she asked.

“Of how unready we are. Apparently such possibilites had been considered by great mathematicians, Riemann, Klein, and so on, but normal people? The very sight of this unsettles their reason.”

“And you leave it on public display?”

“One like it near each entrance. Those who cannot countenance this, must be identified before they are exposed to the more severe shocks of Martian philosophy.”

Later, after night had fallen, sharing tea by a cosy fireplace in his chambers, she and Sir Arthur exchanged guarded truths: the Empire’s pride in its salvaged technology, the colonies’ bitterness at promises of progress that never came, and the changing of the world order.

“You believe the Empire is weakened?” she asked.

“Even before this invasion, there was rot.” He replied, “That rot might have been cut out, or left to spread; Goodness only knows if it would have been the French Empire or the Russian Empire to take advantage of us, and goodness knows how many decades it would have taken them to be ready, but now… we lost nearly a quarter of our army, and half our navy. We are no longer the only power to fear. The people here know it, the colonies know it, the rest of Europe knows it.”

“And only your experiments with the Martian natural philosophy keep the status quo?”

He regarded her, and for a moment the veneer of empire slipped. “You have it exactly. Behind closed doors, we are scared. For most of my life, I genuinely thought we ruled the waves because we were better. Now, I know it was luck. It isn't just the Earthly powers that scare us in London. For all any of us knows, perhaps countless other worlds besides Earth and Mars know about this war, too.”

“The distance between stars is much larger than that between worlds. I would have to see something quite remarkable, even by the standards set with Martian philosophy, to fear that.”

“Quite so.”

“I infer you have such a thing?”

“Naturally. I dared not say so in the telegram, but one such artefact is the real reason I called for you.”

Doctor Choudhary looked out through the high window, the city stretched outward: gas streetlights glimmering below and stars glimmering above. She let herself be Elizabeth again, and shivered; somewhere in the dark, one church bell tolled, then countless more, marking the passing of another quarter hour.

“Tell me, Sir Arthur,” she said quietly, “when you look at the sky now, do you feel wonder, or dread?”

He hesitated, then looked upward through the window. The stars shimmered faintly. Was Mars always so bold? It was difficult to remember. He had found astronomy so boring until the invasion, now he found himself asking if each star had its own multitude of planets, with their own peoples. There were two inhabited worlds around Earth's home Sun, so it seemed likely that every dot in the sky would have something. And yet, not even just the dots: the Milky Way was so-named because it was a pale band of light in the sky, almost none of the stars within it bright enough to be seen individually by a human eye, only bright enough in combination.

“Both, Doctor,” he said. “Both.”

His eyes were drawn to movement far below. A messenger on horseback, riding hard across the courtyard. Soon enough, they were breathless at the door, bearing urgent news for Sir Arthur. There had been another incident at a Martian wreck site: two dozen engineers and soldiers had disappeared without trace, not even leaving burn marks from a mis-fired heat-ray.

“This sounds like the Artefact I had intended to show you!” Sir Arthur exclaimed, offering his arm once more. “Come, Dr. Choudhary. The hour may be late, but such incidents require your singular talents.”

Outside, London’s fog thickened, swallowing the lamps one by one. The city slept uneasily, dreaming of tripods and burning skies, while unseen in the void beyond Mars, something vast and patient stirred, watching, waiting.
