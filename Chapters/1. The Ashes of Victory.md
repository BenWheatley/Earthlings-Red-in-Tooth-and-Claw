## Chapter I – The Ashes of Victory

London, September 28th, 1899.

Two years had passed since the Martians died.

Yet London still breathed, smoke pouring forth from chimneys, factories and trains. Beneath the rebuilt facades and polished memorials, the city’s heart beat to a strange, disquieting rhythm. The air smelled faintly of iron and disinfectant, of scorched stone and restless ambition, a civilisation rebuilding itself faster than it could comprehend its ruin. On the Thames, the sunset caught the twisted ribs of a fallen tripod, its shadow stretching across the water like the skeleton of a heathen god, now a memorial to those who had died in the failed invasion.

The people themselves no longer spoke of it as “the invasion”; instead, they called it “the visitation”, as though that might soften the memory of near-annihilation. But the stones remembered, where men and women had become ash and their mortal remains blasted into the walls behind them as permanent shadows. Some nights, when the fog rolled low and the lamps burned orange, the cobbles seemed to hum with the ghosts of heat-rays and dying men.

Dr. Elizabeth Choudhary stepped down from the train at Paddington Station, her gloved hand tightening on the handle of a weathered instrument case, its brass corners scuffed by years of fieldwork, while three porters behind her conveyed her other luggage. The crowd parted awkwardly around her, an Indian woman in an English sari, marked by an Imperial Priority ticket. She felt their alienating gazes as unpleasantly as the cold British rain. Her journey from Calcutta had been long, but the true distance was not geography, but one of culture: although the Empire had made the world smaller, it had never erased those differences.

Sir Arthur awaited her on the platform, as precise as the ticking of a chronometer. His uniform had been tailored down to a civilian cut, the medals tucked discreetly away, but he carried the posture of a man who had stood against the impossible and survived. He removed his hat in greeting.

“Dr. Choudhary, I presume. I am Sir Arthur Pembroke, and on behalf of Her Majesty, I welcome you to London. Please forgive the dust; the Martians were poor guests.”

“Thank you, Sir Arthur,” she replied, her English crisp but musical. “I see the Martians were thorough.”

A faint smile touched his lips, then vanished. “Thorough, yes. Though fortunately also as foolish and mortal as any man.”

Around them, the station pulsed with tension. Empire soldiers in khaki and blue patrolled between porters and foreign delegates. French engineers in stained coats argued beside Russian physicists and German mathematicians; American journalists darted about with notebooks and Sandersons, some offering a small fortune for a single tripod limb; a group of Japanese officials observed everything in silence. Beggars loudly shouted nothings while newspaper stands silently cried from every corner:

```
   MARTIAN CULTS RAIDED IN BIRMINGHAM!
   NEW HEAT-RAY TEST ENDS IN DISASTER!
   ROYAL ASTRONOMERS REPORT STRANGE LIGHTS ON MARS!
```

In one direction she saw group of wretches clustered beneath a statue of Lady Britannia, a slowly-greening copper plaque at its base proclaiming “England Triumphant!”; in another direction she saw an urchin selling fragments of what was supposedly Martian metal, promising luck against “the next lot”, which she estimated would shortly result in one of the Americans discovering they'd been scammed.

Sir Arthur offered his arm. “If you will, Doctor. The carriage is waiting.”

They rode the carriage through a city with ruins patched together by grief and ingenuity. New ministries had risen beside the now-memorialised rubble; one of these, the Imperial Martian Research Institute, was their destination: a looming wonder of the Industrial Age, a tower half glass, half steel, echoing the now-lost Crystal Palace and the still-standing Eiffel Tower. Surrounding the central tower lay dozens of fenced yards filled with Martian wreckage: here the curve of a heat-ray emitter; there, the blackened shell of a fighting-machine’s leg; in some were gathered piles of the strange, half-living metal that still resisted the touch of tools. Crowds gathered around whichever fence seemed to promise the most excitement, and one in particular had Americans hauling a gleaming Sanderson camera into position, cajoling a porter to clear the crowd for a better view of some test.

“All this,” said Sir Arthur, “we study in hopes of understanding our would-be destroyers.”

“Understanding?” Elizabeth demurred, “If you will forgive the liberty, Sir Arthur, I think not. The monographs…”

She was interrupted by a loud hiss of steam, their eyes drawn to events in one of the yards — engineers were testing one of the recovered heat-rays as a gathered crowd watched on. The target was a rubble pile which glowed orange for a brief instant, the outer surface exploding from the stress, but the turbine and dynamo powering it gave out almost immediately and the effect ceased as rapidly as it had started. The crowd gasped, one man crossed himself, two women fainted. The only people who seemed happy wore small red circles upon their person, some a button, others an earring. Elizabeth noticed all that along with the perturbation on the technicians’ faces as their equipment failed them. In the carriage, Sir Arthur and Doctor Choudhary felt the hairs rise on the back of their necks and heard the driver calm the horses.

“You are correct. Two years,” said Sir Arthur, “and we still cannot make their machines obey. Fortunately, our spies tell us that all the other powers are having similar problems both with the remains that ended up in their territories.”

“You can barely make the Martian machines speak,” she replied, “but I am not surprised. It is trivial to calculate the energy needed to get from Mars to Earth as fast as they did, and there is simply no chemical reaction that can deliver that much, and likewise the heat rays. Their natural philosophy is… not of our kind.”

“Indeed. Some call their devices witchcraft; others say that the attack itself was divine chastisement. If it were beyond the mortal realm, I think that would comfort me — but I fear the truth is colder and far less consoling, of a nature that offers no respite to the soul of man.”

“Far colder, Sir Arthur?”

“Quite so. Pray forgive the question, but I understand that in your homeland, a multitude of other gods are worshiped? Krishna and so forth?”

“That is correct, Sir Arthur.” She felt it best to let the man speak rather than to reveal any specifics. On the journey there had been all together too many conversations with those that assumed all Indians must be Hindu, and many more who assumed they must all be Muslim. Some would try to convert her, while others thought themselves clever for knowing the basics of her faith… though often even what little they thought they knew was merely some exciting Romance that, upon reading, they had mistaken for truth. In all cases, she found it served her best to play whichever role was expected of her, dropping the act as soon as such people turned aside.

“Until the invasion, this Kingdom was unified in its belief in one singular God, all good, all knowing, and all powerful. The invasion causes a crisis of faith in many, asking how such a being could permit so much death, how so many innocents could die. The pulpits yet thunder, but the congregations grow thin, and ever more of the people now wear a symbol of the red planet upon their person in place of a cross.”

She didn't let herself smile, the horrors Sir Arthur spoke of were very real, the devotees of the various Martian cults quite serious, but Elizabeth was pleased that Sir Arthur was none of the men she feared he might be. Here the role she could play was “Doctor”, a hard-won title in this age, and her favourite.

“So,” she ventured, “visitors from the Heavens have unmade the faith formerly fixed upon Heaven itself?”

Sir Arthur nodded solemnly. “I feel like an Athenian forced to face the fact that nobody ever found Athena when they climbed to the top of Mount Olympus. Pray do not think me impertinent, Doctor; the subject tends to make me sermonise.”

Doctor Choudhary nodded silently. She had heard a handful of tales about the Greeks, but knew that she knew little of them and cared less for mythology. Perhaps this metaphor was like suggesting no sage had ever found Shiva waiting in the snow of the peaks of Kailash, perhaps not, but now was not the time to ask.

The carriage rattled beneath an archway and drew up within an enclosed courtyard ringed by iron balconies. Sir Arthur, ever the gentleman, helped Doctor Choudhary to alight and began to show her the premises; behind them the driver tended the horses, while uniformed soldiers — soldiers! — busied themselves with her luggage.

The corridors within the Institute proper echoed with the hum of experiment and whispered rivalry. British scientists eyed Elizabeth with polite suspicion; a few nodded curtly, others turned away. Same as it ever was, even in her university days

They paused before a glass display case in which was presented a mesmerising spiral of Martian alloy, the space within genuinely defying geometry: a cast iron shaft had been added by the curator, appearing bent and broken as it crossed the lines of the spiral in the same manner as a straw in water, except that there was a descriptive label explaining that this was apparently no mere illusion, but somehow a fundamental part of the space the structure occupied. Elizabeth stared uneasily at it. What were the implications of geometry itself being so malleable?

“We’ve lost three men cataloguing that specimen. The curator calls it a ‘non-Euclidean artifact.’ I call it a warning.”

“A warning of what?” she asked.

“Of how unready we are. Apparently such possibilities had been considered by great mathematical philosophers, Riemann, Klein, and so on, but normal people? The very sight of this unsettles their reason.”

“Pray forgive my frankness, but you leave such a thing on public display?”

“Indeed. There is one like it near each entrance. Those who cannot countenance this, must be identified before they are exposed to the more severe shocks of Martian philosophy.”

Later, after night had fallen, sharing tea by a cosy fireplace in his chambers, she and Sir Arthur exchanged guarded truths: the Empire’s pride in its salvaged mechanical arts, the colonies’ bitterness at promises of progress that never came, and the changing of the world order.

“You believe the Empire is weakened?” she asked.

“Even before this invasion, there was rot — I beg your pardon Doctor, an ungracious term I know, but true all the same. That rot might have been cut out, or left to spread; Heaven only knows if it would have been the French Empire or the Russian Empire to take advantage of us, and goodness knows how many decades it would have taken them to be ready, but now… we lost nearly a quarter of our army to the Martians, and half our navy. We are no longer the only power to fear. The people here know it, the colonies know it, the rest of Europe knows it.”

“And only your experiments with the Martian natural philosophy keep the status quo?”

He regarded her, and for a moment the veneer of empire slipped. “You have it exactly. Behind closed doors, we are scared. For most of my life, I genuinely thought we ruled the waves because we were better. Now, I know it was luck. It isn't just the Earthly powers that scare us in London. For all any of us knows, perhaps countless other worlds besides Earth and Mars know about this war, too.”

“The distance between stars is much larger than that between worlds. I would have to see something quite remarkable, even by the standards set with Martian philosophy, to fear that.”

“Quite so.”

“I infer you have such a thing?”

“Naturally. I dared not say so in the telegram, but one such artefact is the real reason I called for you. It should wait for the morning. In the meanwhile,” he rose and walked to a cabinet, “I wonder what you may think of some lesser artefact.”

Intrigued, Doctor Choudhary rose to join him, to examine the object he withdrew from a drawer of his mahogany desk: an enigmatic black slab, roughly two inches by four inches on the broad side and a mere tenth of an inch thick, which he offered and she took in her trembling hands, finding the object strangely warm to the touch.

“We have found many seemingly identical objects just like this, and have already learned some minor details about them, but I rather suspect we have scratched only as deeply into the possibilities as a child upon first seeing within a blacksmith's workshop.”

“I believe I recognise it. One of the monographs I read on the journey here described such a thing. As I recall, the smoother of the two broad surfaces is coated in a single sheet of purest diamond? And you found that it could play sounds, which some believe to be either Martian music or Martian voices and thus propose it is a Martian phonograph?”

“Correct on both counts. Do any additional possibilities present themselves to you?”

“First, I would say phonograph is unlikely from the reports, as the sounds it makes are altogether too short. However there are several experiments I would wish to perform before hypothesising further, if you will permit me a moment.” she laid the object upon the desk, opened her instrument case and withdrew a sheet of paper, which she then placed upon the object's diamond surface. To Sir Arthur's great astonishment, glowing blue hieroglyphs appeared on the paper immediately as it came into contact.

“Good heavens…” he murmured, drawing his hand back rapidly as if from heat before he regained himself, “I believe I have seen those symbols before — embossed upon the levers and buttons found within the war-machines. Good work, but how in God’s name did you make them appear?”

“I have suspected for a while that the Martians see a different part of the spectrum to us. This paper is laced with quinine sulphate, and fluoresces under the influence of the ultraviolet portion of the spectrum.” she left the paper as it was, retrieved a workbook and a pencil, and sketched each symbol. When this was complete, she gently tapped each symbol on the glowing paper in turn, each tap resulting in the emission of its own particular sound, which she also noted and described in her workbook.

“Remarkable!” Sir Arthur clapped his hands, “We noticed the sounds came from pressing certain parts of the object, but we had no idea each sound was associated with its own symbol.”

“That these symbols are elsewhere, from your surprise I infer without sound, adds credence to my belief it is not a Martian answer to our phonographs. But that is simply what this object is not, I still cannot say what the purpose of this object is nor what function it served the Martians. It could be anything — a Martian psalter, or a diary, perhaps even their answer to Mr. Marconi's new wireless telegraph. It will take more than conjecture, however educated, to unravel the secrets of this object.”

“Do not sell yourself short, Doctor, this is marvellous work, and with such rapid deduction! Why, even just this one point of discovery could be to our understanding of the Martians as the Rosetta Stone was to our understanding of the ancient Egyptians!”

“Why thank you, Sir Arthur.”

Outside, one church bell tolled, then countless more, marking the passing of another quarter of an hour. Doctor Choudhary looked out through the high window, the city stretched outward: gas streetlights glimmering below and stars flickering above. She let herself be Elizabeth again, and shivered.

“Tell me, Sir Arthur,” she said quietly, “when you look at the sky now, do you feel wonder, or dread?”

He hesitated, then looked upward through the window. The stars shimmered faintly. Was Mars always so bold? It was difficult to remember. He had found astronomy so boring until the invasion, now he found himself asking if each star had its own multitude of planets, with their own peoples. There were two inhabited worlds around Earth's home Sun, so it seemed likely that every dot in the sky would have something. And yet, not even just the dots: the Milky Way was so-named because it was a pale band of light in the sky, almost none of the stars within it bright enough to be seen individually by a human eye, only bright enough in combination.

“Both, Doctor,” he said. “Both.”

His eyes were drawn to movement far below. A messenger on horseback, riding hard across the courtyard. Soon enough, they were breathless at the door, bearing urgent news for Sir Arthur. There had been another incident at a Martian wreck site: two dozen engineers and soldiers had disappeared without trace, not even leaving burn marks from a mis-fired heat-ray.

“This sounds like the artefact I had meant to place before you!” Sir Arthur exclaimed, offering his arm once more. “Come, Dr. Choudhary. I beg you’ll forgive the hour, but such incidents require your singular talents.”

As they departed, the unwatched symbols on the quinine paper disappeared, only to be replaced by others. Outside, London’s fog thickened, swallowing the lamps one by one, and above Mars shone red and watchful.
